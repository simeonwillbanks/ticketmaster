module TicketMaster::Provider
  module Base
    # The base ticket class for ticketmaster
    # All providers should inherit this class
    #
    # The difference between the class methods and instance methods are that the instance
    # methods should be treated as though they are called on a known ticket and the class
    # methods act based on a blank slate (which means the info to find a specific ticket has
    # to be passed in the parameters in the ticket)
    #
    # Methods that the provider should define if feasible:
    #
    # * reload!
    # * initialize
    # * close
    # * save
    # * destroy
    #
    # Methods that would probably be okay if the provider left it alone:
    #
    # * self.create
    # * update
    # * update!
    # * self.find
    #
    # A provider should define as many attributes as feasibly possible. The list below are 
    # some guidelines as to what attributes are necessary, if your provider's api does not
    # implement them, point it to an attribute that is close to it. (for example, a title
    # can point to summary. and assignee might point to assigned_to. Remember to alias it in your class!)
    # 
    # * id
    # * status
    # * priority
    # * title
    # * resolution
    # * created_at
    # * updated_at
    # * description
    # * assignee
    # * requestor
    # * project_id

      # * find(<project_id>, [#, #, #]) - Returns many tickets with these ids
      # * find(<project_id>, :first, :title => 'ticket name') - Returns the first ticket based on the ticket's attribute(s)
